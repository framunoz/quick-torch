# Quick, Torch!

Quick, Torch! is a simple package that provides a ["Quick, Draw!"](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) dataset using the abstract class `VisionDataset`, provided by `torchvision` API. This package mirrors the [MNIST](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html) dataset provided in torchvision.

You can install this package with
```
pip install quick-torch --upgrade
```

# Example
Here are a simple example of usage:
```python
from quick_torch import QuickDraw
import torchvision.transforms as T


ds = QuickDraw(
    root="dataset", 
    categories="face", 
    download=True, 
    transform=T.Resize((128, 128))
)
print(f"{len(ds) = }")
first_data = ds[0]
first_data

>>> Downloading https://storage.googleapis.com/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap/face.npy
>>> 
>>> len(ds) = 161666
>>> (<PIL.Image.Image image mode=L size=128x128>, 108)
```
