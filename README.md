A simple package that provides a Quick, Draw! dataset using the PyTorch API. It can be installed locally via the following command:

```

You can check an example of the library [here](./example.ipynb)

# TODO
* [ ] Generate a random form using seeds to separate the datasets by train and test.
* [ ] Make datasets of different categories to be concatenated.
* [ ] Add a transformation for the targets.
